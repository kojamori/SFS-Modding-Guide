# Presenting Your Mod

When presenting your mod to the community, you must ensure that you provide clear and concise information about what your mod does, how to install it, and any dependencies it may have. This will help users understand the purpose of your mod and how to use it effectively.

You should cover a few main points, which are listed in order:

- What your mod is
- What platforms it supports
- What your mod does
- How to install your mod
- How to use your mod
- Any media showcasing your mod
- The license under which your mod is released

## Mod Description

Your mod description should provide a brief overview of what your mod does, its features, and any important information that users should know. This description will often be the first thing users see when they come across your mod, so make it engaging and informative.

## Installation Instructions

Provide clear and detailed installation instructions for your mod. This should include information on where to place the mod files, any required dependencies, and any additional steps that users need to take to get your mod up and running.

Typically, the installation instructions should cover:

1. Downloading and/or building the mod files from the appropriate source (e.g., GitHub, etc.).
2. Placing the mod files in the correct directory (e.g., `Mods/YourModName/`).
3. Ensuring that any dependencies are also installed and loaded before your mod.
4. Launching the game and verifying that the mod is working as intended.

## Usage Instructions

If your mod has specific usage instructions or requires configuration, provide clear guidance on how to use it. This may include:

- How to access any new features or functionality added by your mod.
- Any configuration options that users can adjust.
- Troubleshooting tips for common issues that users may encounter.

## Screenshots and Media

Including screenshots or videos of your mod in action can help users understand what to expect and showcase the features of your mod. Visual aids can be particularly helpful for mods that add new parts, textures, gameplay mechanics and especially custom solar systems.

When including media, ensure that:

- The images or videos are clear and of high quality.
- They accurately represent the features and functionality of your mod.
- You have permission to use any media that is not your own creation.

## Documentation

This is a very important section because it provides not only users but also developers with the necessary information to understand and use your mod effectively. Good documentation can significantly enhance the user experience and reduce support requests.

### API Reference

If your mod provides an API for other mods to use, include a detailed API reference section. This should cover:

- Classes, methods, properties, and events exposed by your mod.
- Usage examples for each API component.

### Change Log

Maintain a change log that documents the changes made in each version of your mod. This helps users understand what has been added, changed, or fixed in each release.

### Semver Versioning

Adopt semantic versioning (Semver) for your mod releases. This involves using a version number format of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, where:

- MAJOR version is incremented for incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version is incremented for adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner,
- PATCH version is incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.

### Known Issues, Incompatibilities, and Limitations

Document any known issues, incompatibilities with other mods, or limitations of your mod. This transparency helps users make informed decisions about using your mod and can reduce frustration if they encounter problems.

Mods often can and will break each other and the game itself, so being upfront about any known issues is beneficial for both you and your users. It also helps build trust within the community and lets users know that you are actively maintaining and supporting your mod.

### Lifecycle

If you have plans for the future development of your mod, such as upcoming features, bug fixes, or deprecation plans, include a lifecycle or roadmap section. This informs users about the ongoing support and development status of your mod.

If you have decided to stop maintaining your mod, clearly state this in the documentation so users are aware that they may not receive updates or support in the future.

## License Information

Clearly state the license under which your mod is released. This informs users of their rights and responsibilities when using, modifying, or distributing your mod. Common licenses include the GNU General Public License (GPL), MIT License, and Creative Commons licenses.

## Support and Contact Information

If you are open to providing support for your mod, include information on how users can contact you or seek help. This may include:

- A link to a discussion forum or community page.
- An email address or social media handle.
- Instructions for reporting bugs or requesting features, such as through a GitHub Issues page, etc.

# What are code mods

Code Mods are mods that alter the games code.

**Note that code mods are only supported on PC and are incompatible for the mobile versions of the game.**

They are a part of authorised game mods seen here.

# Installing Code Mods

Most Code Mods would have a github.  
Lets use Astro the Rabbit's Aero Trajectory Mod as Example

Here you can see there is a download button that downloads the latest version of that Mod but lets press on sources since some mods just give you a github page

Now here you should press releases

After that you should be taken to a page that looks like this

Clck on the .dll to download the mod  
Now you need to navigate to "Spaceflight Simulator Game/Mods" and put the .dll there  
If you done everything correctly this is what it should look like

<Figure

Now open the game and it should put the .dll in a folder and it should also appear in the Mod Loader.  
If it does then congrates you done it correctly.

Enjoy your mods!

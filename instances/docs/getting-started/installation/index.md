# Mod Installation

There are 4 types of mods as mentioned in the [introduction](getting-started/introduction), code mods, texture packs, part packs, and custom solar systems (planet packs). The installation process for each type of mod is slightly different but is generally straightforward and the same across all supported platforms (Windows, macOS, and Android).

## Game Folder Locations

Before installing mods, you need to locate the game folder where SFS is installed. The location of the game folder varies depending on the platform:

- **Windows**: The game folder is typically located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Spaceflight Simulator\Spaceflight Simulator Game\Mods` or, depending on your installation.
- **macOS**: The game folder is typically located at `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Spaceflight Simulator/Spaceflight Simulator Game/Mods`.
- **Android**: The game folder is typically located at `/storage/emulated/0/Android/media/com.StefMorojna.SpaceflightSimulator/Mods`.
  - Note that root user is no longer required to access the SFS game folder on Android as of SFS 1.6.0. You can use a regular file manager app to navigate to the SFS game folder.

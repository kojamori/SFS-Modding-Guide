# Adding Links

This tutorial will guide you through adding hyperlinks to your documentation. Links connect related content, provide references, and enhance navigation.

## Step 1: Identify the Link Target

Determine what you want to link to:

- An external website
- Another section in the same document
- A different document in your project

## Step 2: Adding the Link

Use this Markdown syntax:

```
[Link Text](URL)
```

Replace `Link Text` with your display text and `URL` with the target path.

### External Links

Link to external websites using the full URL:

```markdown
[Visit Team Curiosity](https://teamcuriosity.com)
```

### Internal Links

Link to other documents using relative paths or slugs. Slugs are URL-friendly versions of document titles (lowercase, hyphen-separated).

The default slug is `(routeBasePath)/(file-path)`. Documents with `index.mdx` files use only their folder path as the slug.

**Examples:**

```markdown
[Getting Started Guide](/getting-started)
[Texture Pack Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart/texture-pack)
```

## Practical Examples

### Linking Within the Same Instance

Current location: `internal-docs/tutorials/adding-links.mdx`

To link to `internal-docs/architecture.mdx`, use a relative path from the `tutorials` folder:

```markdown
[Documentation Architecture](../architecture)
```

Result: [Documentation Architecture](../architecture)

### Linking Across Instances

To link to `docs/getting-started/index.mdx` from any instance, use an absolute path from the site root:

```markdown
[Getting Started Guide](/getting-started)
```

Result: [Getting Started Guide](/getting-started)

**Note:** The `docs` instance has an empty base route path, so use `/getting-started` directly, along with any other page you want to reference from it.  
The leading `/` indicates the site root.

### Linking from Index Files

For `index.mdx` files, the working directory is the parent folder:

```
parentFolder/
  folder/
    index.mdx  # working directory is parentFolder
  folder2/
    page.mdx
```

From `index.mdx` to `page.mdx`:

```markdown
[Folder2 Page](folder2/page)
```

### Linking to the Home Page

To link to the documentation landing page:

```markdown
[SFS Modding Guide Home](/)
```

Result: [SFS Modding Guide Home](/)
